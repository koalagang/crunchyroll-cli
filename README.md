# Deprecated
To the few crunchyroll-cli stargazers out there:

Though in reality it has basically been deprecated since #e20c0c7, I have decided to officially deprecate crunchyroll-cli and to archive the repository for several reasons:
- I have other projects I'm more interested in working on -- both in terms of free and open-source software to release on GitHub and other parts of my life
- Crunchyroll-cli has been broken for a while now after Crunchyroll's new site left beta
- I haven't really worked on the tool for a couple years and have become less familiar with its small but messy codebase
- Crunchyroll doesn't have Japanese subs (it only has subs for a small handful of European languages) so I'm likely going to be finding a different way of watching anime
- Crunchyroll now requires premium for most stuff

In all honesty, it has always been a bit of a hack but I enjoyed working on it, nonetheless, and it taught me a lot about bash and UNIX shell in general.
I may consider working on something similar to crunchyroll-cli again at some point in the future but I'd like to plan out something that makes more sense, rather than working on an ugly bash script that does weird things like scraping websites with wget.
For anyone wanting to find a replacement, though, I'd caution against forking it as it's just a messy script and you'd be better off starting from scratch or working on another project, like [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli).

To the small number (we're talking like 8 stargazers) of people who did enjoy crunchyroll-cli, thank you.

# Crunchyroll CLI

A CLI tool for browsing and playing anime from [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com).\
It also partially supports GoGoAnime.vc.

Crunchyroll CLI is an easy to use commandline tool, written in bash, which allows you to browse and play anime from the website - Crunchyroll - utilising the mpv media player. It aims to provide a feature rich experience for Crunchyroll whilst being incredibly lightweight.

## Dependencies

* [mpv](https://mpv.io/)
* [fzf](https://github.com/koalagang/crunchyroll-cli)
* [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/)
* [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) - you *probably* already have this installed if you are on GNU/Linux
* [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) - you already have this installed if you are on GNU/Linux
* [devour](https://github.com/salman-abedin/devour) (optional - for window swallowing); NOTE: if the `-p` (premium) flag is passed then window swallowing is not used
* [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) (optional - for downloading episodes)
* [sfeed](https://codemadness.org/sfeed-simple-feed-parser.html) (optional - for viewing Crunchyroll news)
* a menu application (optional - recommended: [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) or [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi); you can use these if you wish to make a separate script which utilises Crunchyroll CLI, however, it is recommended for most people to stick to using the default menu app - fzf.)
* perl - you already have this installed if you have git installed
* gzip (make dependency; not necessary if you are installing [manually](#manual) or with [curl](#curl)) - you *probably* already have this installed if you are on GNU/Linux

## Installation

Before using any of the following installation methods, make sure to download the above listed dependencies with your package manager. 'Make' is the recommended option because you can easily update by doing a simple \
`git pull` on your local repository and also it installs the manpage.

To copy any of the commands shown below to your clipboard, simply hover your cursor over the code block and a clipboard icon will appear to the right-most side - click that and the command will be copied to your clipboard. Now you can just paste that into your terminal emulator with ctrl+shift+v.\
*Easy as pie.* ðŸ˜‹

### cURL

```sh
sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koalagang/crunchyroll-cli/main/crunchyroll-cli" -o /usr/local/bin/crunchyroll-cli && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/crunchyroll-cli
```
> To uninstall, just run `sudo rm /usr/bin/crunchyroll-cli`

### Make
First, if you do not already have it installed on your system, install gzip (it is a make dependency) with your distribution's package manager; it is in pretty much every distro's official repositories.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/koalagang/crunchyroll-cli.git && sudo make -C crunchyroll-cli
```
> To update, run `git pull` in your local Crunchyroll CLI repository and reinstall with `sudo make`.\
> To uninstall, run `sudo make uninstall`.â€Š

### Manual

Download the script, mark it as executable and then place it anywhere in your `$PATH`.
You can easily do this by navigating to the directory you wish to install it to and then running:
```sh
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koalagang/crunchyroll-cli/main/crunchyroll-cli' && chmod +x crunchyroll-cli
```

## Usage

For usage information, input:
```sh
crunchyroll-cli -h
```
or
```sh
man crunchyroll-cli
```
(only works if you installed using Make)

or

read `usage.txt` from the `docs` folder in this repository.

## TODO

* sort seasons
* choose quality
* bulk downloading
* watch history
* proxy option (should be very easy to do; both streamlink and mpv have proxy flags available)
* self-updating (i.e. does not require a package manager to receive update)
* reduce required dependencies (there are certain dependencies which don't necessarily need to be required; for example, I could create a built-in menu rather than making fzf a strict dependency - but I could still keep it as an optional dependency, like dmenu and rofi)
* filter out characters - '(person)' - from the search function
* add suport for beta links (e.g. `https://beta.crunchyroll.com/watch/GJWU2X420/judgment`)
* expand GoGoAnime support

## Note on Crunchyroll beta site

~~Crunchyroll is currently working on a new look for the site. It is in beta but once it leaves the beta and the website is updated from its legacy version, Crunchyroll CLI is likely to break due to changes in links and page sources. I will try to fix it when this happens but it won't necessarily be immediate if my life is very busy at the time of this happening.~~\
~~The new site has left beta. I'll fix crunchyroll-cli at some point in the (likely distant) future.~~\
~~In the meantime, you can use the `-G` flag which allows you to stream from GoGoAnime.vc. See the [Usage](#usage) for more info.~~
See deprecation notice.
