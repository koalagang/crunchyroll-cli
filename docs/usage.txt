Crunchyroll CLI

usage: crunchyroll-cli [OPTIONS] <query>

	In the <anime> field, you may pass the link to a series or an episode or perform a fuzzy search.
	NOTE: when performing a search, it is necessary to use apostrophes or quotation marks otherwise you could end up with something like this:
	`crunchyroll-cli that time` would only search for `time` and not `that time`.

	Below are examples of the correct usage.
	example: crunchyroll-cli "that time"
	example: crunchyroll-cli "https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime"
	example: crunchyroll-cli "https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime/episode-1-the-storm-dragon-veldora-777519"

	Available flags:

	-l	print license info and exit

	-D	print a list of the dependencies and exit

	-d	download instead of streaming (requires youtube-dl)

	-s	show subtitles in your chosen language
		If not specified, no subtitles are shown.
		NOTE: due to the functionality of streamlink, you cannot turn off subtitles *when viewing premium content*; if not specified streamlink will use your system locale.
		example: crunchyroll-cli -s enUS "https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime"

	-S	list available subtitle languages and exit

	-p	play premium content
		Requires signing into a premium Crunchyroll account - you will be prompted with username and password fields.
		NOTE: you cannot download premium content.

	-w	play an anime from your watchlist
		You will be prompted to select an anime.
		After playing an episode, your watchlist will automatically update so that next time it will play the next episode.
		NOTE: requires at least two anime in your watchlist for Crunchyroll CLI to act as expected.
		example: crunchyroll-cli -w

	-a	add an anime to your watchlist (and the next episode to watch followed by the total number of episodes)
		NOTE: if you are unsure how many episodes are left then set the number to "NULL".
		example: crunchyroll-cli -a 11,13 "https://www.crunchyroll.com/higehiro-after-being-rejected-i-shaved-and-took-in-a-high-school-runaway"
		example: crunchyroll-cli -a 25,NULL "https://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece"

	-e	manually your watchlist or completelist
		Uses "$EDITOR".
		You can use the full word (i.e. "watchlist" or "completelist") or you can use the first letter (i.e. "w" or "c").
		example: crunchyroll-cli -e watchlist
		example: crunchyroll-cli -e c

	-c	check the simulcast schedule for this week
		example: crunchyroll-cli -c (free episodes)
		example: crunchyroll-cli -pc (premium episodes)

	-n	check Crunchyroll news (requires sfeed)

	-u	do a fuzzy search and get the URL of an anime
		example: crunchyroll -u "that time i got reincarnated as a slime"
		output: https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime
		TIP: you can easily add a new anime to your watchlist by utilising both the `-a` flag and the `-u` flag
		example: `crunchyroll-cli -u "your lie" | xargs crunchyroll-cli -a "6,22"`

	-m	specify menu application to use
		If not specified, fzf is used.
		You can use any software which can be piped into and out of and used as a menu but it is recommended that you choose between dmenu, rofi and fzf.
		example: crunchyroll-cli -m dmenu "https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime"

	-G	query GoGoAnime.vc instead of Crunchyroll (does not support URLs, only fuzzy searches)
