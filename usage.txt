Crunchyroll CLI

usage: crunchyroll-cli [OPTIONS] <query>

	In the <anime> field, you may pass the link to a series or an episode or perform a fuzzy search.
	NOTE: when performing a search, it is necessary to use apostrophes or quotation marks otherwise you could end up with something like this:
	`crunchyroll-cli that time` would only search for `time` and not `that time`.

	Below are examples of the correct usage.
	example: crunchyroll-cli "that time"
	example: crunchyroll-cli "https://www.crunchyroll.com/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime"
