Crunchyroll CLI - browse and play anime from Crunchyroll
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
crunchyroll-cli [\f[B]OPTIONS\f[R]] \[lq]\[rq]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Crunchyroll CLI is an easy to use commandline interface tool, written in
bash, which allows you to browse and play anime from the website -
Crunchyroll (https://crunchyroll.com) - utilising the mpv media player.
It also helps you to keep track of anime by allowing you to create a
watchlist and which remembers what episode you are on so that you can
easily play the next episode next time you want to watch.
Additionally: once you finish an anime, it will be moved from your
watchlist to your completelist.
.SH SEARCH FIELD
.PP
In the field, you may pass the link to a series or an episode or perform
a fuzzy search.
NOTE: when performing a search, it is necessary to use apostrophes or
quotation marks otherwise you could end up with something like this:
\f[C]crunchyroll-cli that time\f[R] would only search for \f[C]time\f[R]
and not \f[C]that time\f[R].
.PP
Below are examples of the correct usage.
