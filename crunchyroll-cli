# Just disabling some shellcheck errors. The points made are valid but, in certain unique situations, they should be ignored.
# By the way, if anyone can help with the last two - please do.

# This is being flagged due to the examples made in the printf help statement. I'm using apostrophes on purpose because I don't want commands in this statement to actually be run.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# This is being flagged due to my use of variables (such as "$swallow" for example) which are being used without double quotes, however, in these cases I want bash to interpret them as
# commands and not as strings so I don't double quote.
# shellcheck disable=SC2086
# It's supposed to be `if A is true but B is false then run C`, not `if A then B else C` so bash is behaving just as I intended it to do.
# shellcheck disable=SC2015
# I agree. The cat is a "useless cat" but, for some reason the command I am trying to do does not work without doing this. Further detail in a comment near the bottom of the script.
# shellcheck disable=SC2002
# Not sure I really understand the point being made here.
# shellcheck disable=SC2094
